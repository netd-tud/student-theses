  abstract = {BGP connects autonomous systems (ASs) on the Internet by announcing (and withdrawing) routes. Route Flap Damping (RFD) withdraws prefixes for which too many route changes are received to prevent frequent, redundant best path selection in routers. Since its introduction in the 90’s, recommendations on configuration and use have been a back and forth, primarily because RFD can lead to unreachability of well behaving prefixes. The state of deployment was not measured, yet. In this study, we introduce an approach to measure RFD using custom BGP Beacons and public data from BGP route collector projects. From seven locations in the Internet core we insert our Beacons based on a custom schedule to trigger a clear RFD signature. We determine RFD usage on AS paths based on the output signal of the three largest route collector projects. Then, we design and apply heuristics to pinpoint RFD ASs. In our study we uncover that 60\% of measured ASs are using deprecated, harmful vendor default configurations. And, against the expectation of the Internet community, we find that at least 6\% of measured ASs are using RFD.},
